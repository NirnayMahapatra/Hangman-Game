# Hangman-Game
The programming language which i have used in this project is C++
So hangman game is basically a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.
In my project its all about guessing country names.
Each player have 5 chances.
In each chance they have to write a letter and if the letter is correct then a country name will be displayed.
If it is wrong then you will be hanged and the game gets over
